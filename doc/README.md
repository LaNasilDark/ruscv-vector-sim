## Project Overview

The RISC-V Vector Simulator is a Rust-based tool designed to simulate the RISC-V vector extension instruction set architecture. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for testing and validating the execution of RISC-V vector instructions.

### Key Features
- Configurable function units with customizable latencies
- Vector register file simulation
- Memory unit with configurable access patterns
- Buffer system for instruction chaining
- Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
